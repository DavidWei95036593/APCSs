Introduction:
The purpose of this homework was to implement the coding bat problems in setstuff
into java files
Specification:
My submission meets all the requierments, and the codes are working in coding bat.

Errors
I had serval errors while doing this in codingbat, but I manage to fix them and now they were all
working

Overview of Code
See comments in each class, the main class was a class to test them
see comments in main class to know which method it is tested on.
Each class was made into its own file

Major Challenges
the most fun part was the nearestUnvisitedNodes, but I pay attention in class and
made some notes so I was able to do it by myself

Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank to Hunter North and Jack Zhang for helping me on this project,
I had some problem of understanding the question in collectNodes, I thought it should 
return the new array with only the repeated values
But Jack pointed to me that it should return the union of the first two
After that I still compared my code to hunters because I was using if for many cases that
made my cod messy and I was unable to find the error
Hunter says he just used a for loop to performe both cases for(i=0 ;i<2; i++) instead of 
rewrite the whole section of codes again.
I follow his idea and my cod works
